# Interfaces

An interface is supposed to be a way of bi-directional communication with the **OUTER-WORLD**.

Not with a business-related entity, not with a database, but **with a client**.

## When to put something here

**Ask yourself**: Is this a client-communication interface?

If the answer is **yes** then put it here.
