# Infrastructure

The infrastructure includes everything non-business related.
Especially when it's not related to a specific domain and can be used by multiple.

## When to put something here

**Ask yourself**: Is this a business-related entity or just the the infrastructure that the business is built upon?

If the answer is **yes** -> place it here
